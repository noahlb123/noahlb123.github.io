[During Kwanzaa 2024 I planned to write an essay during every day of the holiday, but I only wrote for 2/7. I will save my self criticism on not finishing for next year's essays.]

﻿Umoja (Unity)
Kwanzaa is a holiday founded in 1966 by black power activist, Maulana Karenga. Kwanzaa is an explicitly African American holiday that synthesizes ideas and practices from black nationalism, pan-Africanism, socialism, and traditions celebrated in North, West, East, and Southeast Africa. Kwanzaa takes place over 7 days, each of which celebrates one of the Nguzo Saba (seven principles). Today on the first day of Kwanzaa, December 26th, Umoja (unity) is celebrated. Maulana has written extensively on each of the Nguzo Saba, including in his book “Kwanzaa: A Celebration of Family, Community and Culture” and in his annual Kwanzaa Founder’s Message. The following is one quote from Maulana that I believes best summarizes Umoja,


“If unity is in essence a principle, it is no less a practice as are all the other principles. For practice is central to African ethics and all claims to ethical living and commitment to moral principles are tested and proved or disproved in relations with others… Character development is not simply to create a good person abstracted from community, but rather a person in positive interaction, a person whose quality of relations with others is defined first of all by a principled and harmonious togetherness, i.e., a real and practiced unity. Another way of discussing unity is to see it as… a firm dependable togetherness that is born, based and sustained in action… In the end practice proves everything. No matter how many books one reads on swimming, sooner or later [they] must get into the water and swim… Finally, unity means a oneness, a similarity and sameness that gives us an identity as a people, an African people. And inherent in this identity as a people is the ethical and political imperative to self-consciously unite in order to define, defend and develop our interests.”


I understand Umoja as the practice and principle of uniting African Americans within America, Africans across Africa, and people between Africa, America, and the world. So what then does Umoja and Kwanzaa have to do with our white family? I argue that white colonist states, most overwhelmingly the United States, are threatened by and actively suppress black unity throughout the world. The most obvious historical example of this was the Scramble for Africa where white colonist states divided and colonised Africa, but colonial suppression of black unity is very much ongoing today, including within the US where there is continued effort to ban critical race theory from public education. We are white Americans living within the imperial core where we benefit everyday from the destruction of black unity through the global south’s wealth extraction and the legacy of white colonialism. For this reason, white Americans are a very small global minority of people that have a direct responsibility and ability to deconstruct their country’s black oppression.


In short I believe that some aspirations of African American Umoja are only possible with some unity from white Americans. This is why I am observing Kwanzaa this year. Not to celebrate the practices as my own, but to learn and reflect on my white relation to Kwanzaa’s Nguzo Saba.


Kujichagulia (Self-Determination)
The second day of Kwanzaa celebrates Kujichagulia (Self-Determination). On this Nguzo (principle) Maulana writes,


“The first act of a free people is to shape its world in its own image and interest. And it is a statement about their conception of self and commitment to self-determination. Kawaida, building on the teachings of Frantz Fanon, states that each person must ask him or herself three basic questions: ‘Who am I, am I really who I am, and am I all I ought to be?’”


In “The Wretched of the Earth,” Frantz Fanon explains that colonization negates the identities of the colonized, and redefines them in terms of colonial structures of power. Maulana offers Kwanzaa as an anti-colonial way to define identity by synthesizing the cultural identities of various African groups in the context of pan-African, black nationalist, and socialist philosophies. 


Like African Americans, white Americans are also encouraged to define themselves in terms of colonial power structures, though instead of being the objects of colonialism, our relation to colonisation is as beneficiaries. Likewise we often seek to emphasize our power and status within systems of exploitation. When we are asked “What do you do?” we respond with our job titles. Outside of our employment, white identities focus on consumer and individualistic hobbies co-opted by capitalism: “I like board games”, “I am a fan of a sports team” or “I rock climb”. I would argue that even the hobby identity “I read” is a colonised identity, because it is a solitary activity that has no relation to any culture or community.


So for those of us who have no African heritage what cultural basis could we use to begin to decolonise our identities? I advocate for two approaches:


First to build a sense of heritage and cultural roots I offer everyone’s collective history of resistance. Through any period of history and group of people the only thing that is guaranteed to be found is radical change, most often brought about by the organized power of people. This is just as true for the history of Americans and America, a country that was created through the violent and resistive property destruction of the Boston Tea Party. This collective resistance has continued throughout American history, with the American labor movement’s many victories, which directly affect the working conditions of every American today. By building an identity based on collective resistance we may also see the connection between ourselves and all people of all races during all periods of human history where collective power has always been present.


And second to define ourselves in terms of the local communities that we participate in. I believe that this has historically been the most powerful way people can build an identity, but the many interests that are opposed to collective power have pulled us away from these identities, primarily by removing people from communities altogether. But there are still plenty of opportunities for community: community theater, gardens, art groups, reading groups, activists, labor unions, and mutual aid are just a few possibilities.
