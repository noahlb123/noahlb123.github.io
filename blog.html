var temp = `The World’s Best Under a Tainted Sun

There was once a small town called farmville. There were only two jobs in farmville: one hundred farmers and one scientist. The farmers loved the scientist, because he was the best scientist in the whole world, and the scientist loved the farmers because they were the best farmers. Farmville was so small, every single person who lived there could hear you if you yelled. One morning when all the farmers were farming, the scientist went outside and yelled “I have made an important discovery! Farmville’s farms are tainting the sunlight.” This made one farmer angry. She yelled “Sunlight cannot be tainted by farms! That is impossible!” A farmer in between them had especially sensitive ears. He threw his hands up and yelled “Everyone is being too loud! Let’s talk about this where no one has to yell, and when no one is busy farming!” The scientist yelled one last time “I will wait until this evening when no one is farming, but the longer farmville does not know about its sunlight the worse it will get!” Then he left the farmers to their farming.

That evening, the farmers and the scientist went to a comfortable place to talk and listen. The scientist stood up and said “I know that my discovery may be shocking, but there is no doubt that it is true. I am the world’s best scientist. I work with the most care, I use the best methods, and I have the least bias. As a scientist should, I will show you evidence that supports my claim.” The scientist presented graphs and data that showed that the sunlight was being tainted by Farmville’s farms. When he was done the farmer who used to be angry said “I am sorry that I got angry at you. Your graphs and data clearly show that Farmville’s farms are tainting the sunlight. You are the world’s best scientist and you prove it to us everyday by doing good science, but what can we do to preserve our sunlight?” “The only way to preserve the sunlight is to farm less” said the scientist. “But how can we farm less?” asked the once angry farmer “We eat every single thing we grow, if we farm less we will be hungry.” The scientist paused to think, then said “I don’t know anything about farming. I have to focus my whole life on science in order to be the best scientist, just like how you all became the world’s best farmers. I have discovered that we need to farm less, now you farmers have to figure out how to do it.” The farmers nervously agreed and then everyone went home.

The next morning while all the farmers were farming the scientist went outside and yelled “I am going to the forest to experiment. While I am gone you farmers need to figure out how to farm less or our sunlight will be tainted.” All the farmers nodded their heads and the scientist left. While he was gone the farmers farmed and talked about how they could farm less. Everyone thought very hard but none of them had any good ideas. When the scientist returned, everyone gathered around him and he asked “Has anyone figured out how to farm less?” Everyone was quiet, and then the farmer with especially sensitive ears threw up his hands and said “Farmville is named after farming, and everyone but you is a farmer! I cannot imagine a farmville with less farming!” The scientist shook his head and said “You do not understand how important this is! Let me help you understand by explaining the discoveries I made today. Today I discovered exactly how we will die if the sunlight becomes tainted.” The scientist presented diagrams and illustrations. “See?” The scientists said “If our sunlight is tainted everyone will die a horrible death! The sun will turn red and we will choke and cry and feel like we are on fire! What is even worse is that we only have two days left to start farming less before we will certainly taint the sunlight! Now that you understand how bad things could get and how fast we need to change, won’t you find a way to farm less?” All the farmers nervously nodded their heads and the once angry farmer said “You are the world’s best science communicator and the world’s best scientist! Thanks to you we all understand how important it is to farm less! We will decide by tomorrow evening!” Everyone smiled and agreed and went home.

The next morning while all the farmers were farming the scientist went outside and yelled “I am going to the forest to experiment. Remember your promise you made last evening and figure out how to farm less!” All the farmers nodded their heads and the scientist left. While he was gone the farmers farmed and tried as hard as they possibly could to think of a way to farm less. One farmer thought so hard that her face got red and her head started hurting. She threw up her arms and said “In school all I learned about was farming, and now all the books in farmville are about farming! How can we farm less when farming is all we know!” Everyone nervously nodded their heads, and a few moments later the scientists returned. He said “Has anyone figured out how to farm less?” The farmer whose face was still red cried “No! It is impossible to farm less!” The scientist got very upset and said “No one is taking this seriously! If we do not farm less we will die horrible deaths! Let me explain what I learned today. Today I figured out how sure I am that my past two discoveries were correct. Now I am ninety nine point nine percent certain that if we do not start farming less by tomorrow night our sunlight will be tainted and we will and die horrible deaths! Now that you understand that my findings are ninety nine point nine percent certain, won’t you start farming less?” All the farmers nervously nodded their heads and got to work thinking. No one went to bed that night.

The next morning while all the farmers were farming and thinking the scientist went outside and yelled “I am going to the forest to experiment. While I am gone you farmers need to figure out how to farm less or our sunlight will be tainted by tonight!” All the farmers nodded their heads and the scientist left. All the farmers thought as hard as they possibly could but no one had any good ideas. With tears in her eyes, the once angry farmer said “We all know it is too late to change! Even if we could think of something it is too late to start doing it, we may as well enjoy ourselves for one last day instead of wasting our time!” All the farmers nodded their heads, then they all went to a comfortable place to talk and listen and threw a joyful party and no one thought about farming less or tainted sunlight. Then the scientists returned, and when he saw the party he got very upset and said “You all deserve to die horrible deaths!” But no one could hear him. He continued yelling “I showed you exactly what you needed to do, but you did not do it! And now we will all choke and cry and feel like we’re burning because of you farmers!”

The next morning a red sun rose over Farmville. One by one the people of Farmville started choking and crying and feeling like they were on fire. The scientist went outside and yelled while he choked and cried “I was the world’s best scientist! The only mistake I ever made was thinking Farmville had the world’s best farmers!”`
